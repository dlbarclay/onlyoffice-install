When installed with nextcloud on the same server, changing the ports from 80/443 to alternate ports seems to work.
The server can use the same certificates for both servers, but for some reason the browser doesn't automatically accept them when run on different ports.
To make nextcloud accept the settings with a self-signed certificate, the following must be added to /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php
    'onlyoffice' =>
    array (
      'verify_peer_off' => TRUE,
    )
This tells nextcloud to allow unverified (self-signed) certificates from the onlyoffice document server.
